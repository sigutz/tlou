            <h2>The Last of Us Part II is an action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony
                Interactive Entertainment. It was released for the PlayStation 4 in June 2020.<br><br>

                The game takes place five years after the events of the first game and follows the story of Ellie, who
                sets out on a journey of revenge after a traumatic event. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world
                where a fungal infection has turned most of humanity into zombie-like creatures.<br><br>

                The gameplay of The Last of Us Part II is similar to its predecessor, with a mix of stealth,
                exploration, and combat. Players control Ellie through various environments, solving puzzles, and
                engaging in battles with both infected and human enemies.<br><br>

                The game features a strong emphasis on storytelling, with cinematic cutscenes and character-driven
                moments interspersed throughout the gameplay. It has received widespread critical acclaim for its
                complex characters, emotional storytelling, and innovative gameplay mechanics.<br><br>

                However, the game has also been the subject of controversy and backlash from some fans due to its
                controversial narrative decisions and portrayal of certain characters. Despite this, it has been praised
                by many for its boldness and willingness to take risks with its storytelling.<br><br></h2>
